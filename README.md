## Greetings, I'm Juan Gabriel
> ⚡ Fun fact: I start coding in 1998, mainly modifying .bat files for games using Notepad or CMD. By 2001, my brother was learning web design with Adobe Dreamweaver, Fireworks, and Flash. So I took Flash, stole a Squashing mosquitoes sample game, and modified its vectors and graphics to create a teacher in a classroom squashing flying paper balls. I exported it to HTML so my teachers could play it. Since then I've been writing code sporadically when the need arises, regardless of the language.
