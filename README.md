## Greetings, I'm Juan Gabriel
> ⚡ Coding since 1998 (8yo). Back then, modifying .bat files for games using Notepad or CMD. By 2001 (11yo), I took a Squashing mosquitoes sample game on Adobe Flash, and modified its vectors and graphics to create a "teacher in a classroom squashing flying paper balls". Since then, I've been writing code sporadically.
- 🌱 Coming up on 2018, I had been focusing my efforts on web development (HTML, CSS, JS, ANGULAR, SPRINGBOOT).
- In 2022, I had begun a 3 years higher education studies in software development, while pursuing a certification in Full Stack Web Development.
- Later in 2023, I obtained a certification in Intermediate Java Development by a University as a next stage of the Full Stack certification program from my previous year.
