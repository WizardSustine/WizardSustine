## Greetings, I'm Juan Gabriel
> ⚡ Fun fact: I started coding in 1998 (8yo), mainly modifying .bat files for games using Notepad or CMD. By 2001 (11yo), my brother was learning web design with Adobe Dreamweaver, Fireworks, and Flash. So I took Flash, stole a Squashing mosquitoes sample game, and modified its vectors and graphics to create a teacher in a classroom squashing flying paper balls. I exported it to HTML so my teachers could play it. Since then I've been writing code sporadically when the need arises, regardless of the language.
- 🔭 I'm currently making apps on Android Studio with JAVA and SQL, for my own personal purposes.
- 🌱 Since 2018, I've been focusing my efforts on web development, and JAVA development caught my attention.
- 💬 My work experience where focused on analyzing needs and resources, organizing tasks, and dealing with clients, providers, architects, engineers, and lawyers. Also, reading architects drawings and calculating.
- 🤔 Identify needs for enhance our daily work and offering solutions was it my own initiative.
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: Now I've chosen to work on offering smart solutions.
